Playing with [chi router](https://go-chi.io/#/README).

__Routing__ refers to how an appliacation's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

__Middleware__ performs some specific function on the HTTP request or response at a specific stage in the HTTP pipeline before or after the user defined controller. Middleware is a design pattern to eloquently add cross cutting concerns like logging, handling authentication without having many code contact points.
