Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern commonly used for implementing user interfaces. It divides application into three layers (components) to separate internal representation of information from its presentation to the user.

* model - data layer (e.g. information about user)
* view - presentation layer (e.g. HTML showing information about user)
* controller - ties everything together

To run the code do `go run .` and visit http://localhost:8080/user?id=1.
